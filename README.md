Author: Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, jyotirmoy@jyotirmoy.net, https://www.jyotirmoy.net

The problems are taken from Williams, 'Model Building in Mathematical Programming'

`twoPlantX.jl` are scripts solving the combined problem in Example 4.1 in increasing
levels of fanciness.

`powerGen.jl` solves Example 12.15.
